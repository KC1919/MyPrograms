used the slow and fast pointer approach.
​
took three pointers.
slow pointer- to stop at the kth node from the end.
fast pointer- to make slow pointer stop at kth position from the end.
left pointer- to stop at the kth node from the start.
​
after the loop, when the left and slow pointers are at their correct positions
we do the swapping of their values.
