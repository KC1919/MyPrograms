the intuition behind this approach is that, first we sort the array
â€‹
and then we find the absolutw difference of all the values from the middle value, because
all the values can be made equalto the middle value with minimum number of steps, because middle value would be closer to left as well as right side elements, sicnce the array is sorted.
