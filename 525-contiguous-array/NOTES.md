Used the concept of Longest Contiguous Subarray with sum equal to 0.
​
Similar to that, in this question, treat all 0's as -1, and the problem becomes exactly same as the above problem.
​
As adding -1 and 1 will give zero, and that would only be possible when there are equal number of -1's and 1's in that subarray. Hence there will be equal number of 0's as 1 ,since we are treating 0's as -1.
