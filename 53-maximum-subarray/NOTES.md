the intuition behind this approach is that,
​
as soon as our sum becomes negative we reset it back to 0.
​
Because taking forward the negative sum and adding them with elements further would result in reduced values.
​
And as we want maximum sum, so we reset the sum to 0 if it at any point becomes 0.
