the intuition behind this approach is choice making
​
Once a element wants to be the part of the subset.
Once the element does not want to be the part of the subset.
​
So every element has two choices, either be the part or not be the part.
​
So our main task is to explore all the choices of all the elements and effectively
create out subsets.
​
When all the elemnts have made their choices, then we have one possible subset ready, we add that to the resultant list of subsets.
