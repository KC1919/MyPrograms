in this we first find the left samller and right smaller of every pillar.
​
We calculate right smaller and left smaller using the jump technique.
​
then we take out the span of ith pillar, and multiply by its height, that gives the area sapn of the ith pillar.
​
If its greater than the max area then we update the max area  with the current area of the ith pillar.
​
Else we continue.
​
We do this for all the pillar, and at last we have the lagest area rectangle int he histogram.
