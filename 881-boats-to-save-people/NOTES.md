we use 2-pointer approach.
​
as we can carry maximum 2 people on a boat, so we check
if the weight[left]+weight[right] is less than or equal to the limit of the boat
then we take both the persons.
​
And we move our pointers.
Else if the weight is exceeding the limit of the boat, so we decrement the right pointer.
