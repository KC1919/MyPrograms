if the left element is eodd and right element is even
that means the configuration is not right, so we swap the elements
that is sending the odd element to the right and the even element to the left.
â€‹
if the left element i.e at element at ith index is even we move forward.
and similarly we see if the right element is odd i.e the element at jth index
then we decrement the jth pointer, that means the configuration is right.
