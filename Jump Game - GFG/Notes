The intuition behind the approach, is that.

We satrt from the 2nd last position and we try all possible jumps from that position,
If any jump we take from the ith position, make us reach the destination point or a point from where we can reach the destination.
So we put -1 at the ithindex, which indicates from this index we can reach the destination.
So if anyone can reach a point where -1 is lying so from there destination can be reached.
And this is how this becomes a dynamic programming question.
We chek from all the ith positions trying all possible jumps we can take from there, and we store -1 if at any point we find that we can reach the destiantion from the ith position.

And break from the current iteration.

Then check this for all the indeices.

And in the end we check the value we got at the 0th index.
If we got 01 at the 0th index, that means we can reach the destination starting from the source point.

If its not -1 , that means we cant reach the destination from the sourece point.
