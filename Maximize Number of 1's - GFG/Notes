The intuition behind this approach is that.
We start from the 0th index and we take 2 pointers, i and j.
We take a count variable to count the length of the subarray length with maximum 1's.
We also take a variable to count the number of 0's present in out subarray.
If at any point the number of 0's exceed's the value of M.
We start to remove them till our count of zero comes in range of M.
And accordingly we keep decrementing our count also, till we reach the limit of 0's count.
So basically its a sliding window approach.

We have a max variable in which we store the max length of subarray with maximum number of 1's.
At the end of the iteration we have in out max the maximum count of 1's that can we generated after flipping at most M 0's.
